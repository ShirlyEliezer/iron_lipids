The purpose of this project is to predict qMRI parameters according to iron and lipid
concentrations, and iron types and lipid types.

############################### includes ##############################################

1. main.py: the main file of this project. through this file you can run the entire project. It is
important to update the name of the data file in the tool box file, for correct use.
The file contains the qMRI parameters need to be predicted.

2. toolBox: helper file for the project. important variables and configurations saved there, and all
 the files knows to read variables, dictionaries and arrays from there. save there important
 variables that are relevant for all of the files.

3. processor: The class create instance that read the data, detect and remove outliers and ignore experiments
    that disqualified according to previous decisions.

4. predictor: The file contains the predictor class. Each instance of the class has its own X, y,
    total data. cross validation model - leave one out is defined.

5. plots: The file contains the Plots class. Each instance of the class has its own x axis, y axis,
    total data, title and labels. The other files plots data with instances of the class.


############################### notes ##############################################

if you want to change the models - you need to change it the cross_val function in the main file.
The function categorical_cross_val in the main file - present the model: a*[lipid type]*lipid_type + b*[Fe]*iron_type + c
